<h2>Reasoning Engine: An AI Engine Based on llama</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    An AI system designed to exceed human-level problem-solving in general contexts by: 

1. encoding knowledge in a human-readable graph,
2. performing explicit and auditable reasoning,
3. incorporating new information via data ingestion algorithms assisted by LLMs, and
4. enhancing knowledge accuracy and predictive power through refinement algorithms.
