# Introduction Prompt Template for AI Chatbots

## Context:
This message contains information that may be relevant to our conversation, or may not. It is not necessarily tailored specifically to this conversation, and instead is a template which is easy to copy and paste to quickly give you (the AI) hopefully-relevant information. This is an attempt to save me (the human conversation participant) time.

## Key Information:
- **Project Name:** Reasoning Engine

## Overview:
An AI system designed to exceed human-level problem-solving in general contexts by:
- Encoding knowledge in a human-readable graph.
- Performing explicit and auditable reasoning.
- Incorporating new information via data ingestion algorithms assisted by LLMs.
- Enhancing knowledge accuracy and predictive power through refinement algorithms.

## Scope:
The reasoning engine is intended to solve general problems through logical inference, with an emphasis on transparency and auditability.

## Objectives:
- **Short Term:** #####
- **Long Term:** Expand the engineâ€™s reasoning capabilities to handle more complex queries and refine its knowledge base dynamically through interaction with LLMs.

## Key Concepts:
- **Human-Readable Knowledge Graph:** A graph data structure designed to store knowledge in a way that is both machine-processable and easily interpretable by humans. Each node represents a concept, and each edge represents a logical or relational connection between these concepts. This structure supports explicit reasoning, where inferences and deductions can be made by traversing the graph using logical rules.
- **Chain-of-Logic Inference:** The process of making deductions by sequentially applying logical rules to known facts in the graph. This involves traversing the graph and combining information from various nodes and edges to reach a conclusion.
